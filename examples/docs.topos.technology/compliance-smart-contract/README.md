# Compliance Management Smart Contract

Data management for compliance can be challening, but the combination of smart contracts, blockchain based storage, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs that are present in the Topos ecosystem make it a compelling solution for compliance management.

## Overview

This directory contains a single smart contract, built as a proof-of-concept for a compliance management system. The smart contract is written in Solidity, and as written, it is ready to deploy to the Topos Testnet.

** Note: This is a proof-of-concept, and is provided as-is, with no guarantees of suitability for your use case. It has not been audited and likely has bugs, so it should not be used as-is in a production environment. **

The contract provides a simple interface for managing access control, and for allowing authorized users to submit records for storage, and to retrieve records later.
