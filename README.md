# example-code-depo
This repository will provide a place to keep example code for Topos documentation, tutorials, guides, and even small demos or starter projects.

This includes code that is part of the tutorials on the [Developer Portal](https://docs.topos.technology) as well as other code.

The medium-term intention is that there will be unit tests that cover everything that is committed here, so that there can be greater confidence that code which is referenced in Topos documentation is correct, and if a future change breaks it, that this state is detected early so that it can be fixed.
